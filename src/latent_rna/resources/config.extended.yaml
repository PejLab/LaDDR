  # How to specify datasets and samples and locate bigWig coverage files
  coverage:
    # Method to use for locating bigWig files: directory or manifest
    method: manifest
    # Path to directory containing bigWig files
    # If method is "directory", the datasets and samples will be determined by interpreting this directory's contents as {dataset}/{sample}.bw
    # If method is "manifest", the paths in the manifest file should be relative to this directory.
    directory: ../data_input/covg_bigwig
    # If method is "manifest", path to a headerless tab-delimited manifest file with three columns:
    # dataset, sample, path to bigWig file.
    manifest: coverage_manifest.tsv

  # Optional: List of paths to phenotype tables (BED format) to regress out
  # Files must be in BED format with chromosome, start, end, and phenotype_id,
  # followed by columns of phenotype values. The phenotype ID must be formatted
  # as {gene_id} or {gene_id}__{other_info}, so that gene IDs can be parsed and
  # used to regress them out gene-by-gene.
  # pheno_paths:
  #   - path/to/modality1.bed.gz
  #   - path/to/modality2.bed.gz

# Binning parameters
binning:
  # Method to use for binning: adaptive_covgcorr, adaptive_covgvar, adaptive_diffvar, fixed_width, or fixed_count
  # Whether to determine bins adaptively from coverage data, split all coding/noncoding regions into fixed-width bins, or split each region into a fixed number of bins.
  # TODO describe each method in more detail
  method: adaptive_diffvar
  # Number of genes (at most) per batch
  batch_size: 200
  # Maximum width of any bin
  max_bin_width: 1024
  # Parameters for adaptive binning
  adaptive:
    # Maximum number of coverage samples to use for binning. Samples from all datasets are used, and a random subset is selected if there are more than this number. These samples are used to calculate variance at each base.
    max_samples: 256
    # For method "adaptive_covgvar" or "adaptive_diffvar", approximate number of bins to create per gene on average.  
    bins_per_gene: 256
    # For method "adaptive_covgcorr", minimum allowed mean total coverage per sample for a bin.
    min_mean_total_covg: 128
    # For method "adaptive_covgcorr", maximum allowed correlation between normalized coverage of adjacent bins.
    max_corr: 0.8
  # Parameters for fixed_width binning  
  fixed_width:
    # Width of bins for coding (exonic) regions of the genes.
    coding: 16
    # Width of bins for noncoding (non-exonic) regions of the genes.
    noncoding: 128
  # Parameters for fixed_count binning
  fixed_count:
    # Number of bins per exonic/intronic region
    n_bins_per_region: 24

# Model parameters
model:
  # Set to true if the samples being processed are different from the ones used
  # to train the model. In this case, the existing coverage normalization
  # parameters will be applied to the new samples so they are normalized
  # consistently with the training data.
  use_existing: false
  # Maximum variance explained by PCs to keep. Pass 0 or 1 for no variance explained cutoff.
  var_explained_max: 0.8
  # Maximum number of PCs to keep. Pass 0 for no cutoff.
  n_pcs_max: 16
  # Whether to use functional PCA
  use_fpca: false
  fpca:
    # Use bin numbers ('bin') or genomic positions ('pos') as x-values
    x_values: bin
    # Basis function: discrete or spline
    basis: discrete
