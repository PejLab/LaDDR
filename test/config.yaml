# Default configuration for latent-rna pipeline

# Input files
input:
  # GTF annotation file path. Must be the collapsed annotation produced by `collapse_annotation.py`.
  gtf: ../data_input/collapsed.gtf
  # Chromosome lengths file tab-delimited file with chromosome name and length
  # in first two columns, no header. Additional columns are ignored. (e.g.
  # chrNameLength.txt from STAR index or the *.fa.fai genome FASTA index file)

  # How to specify datasets and samples and locate bigWig coverage files
  coverage:
    # Method to use for locating bigWig files: directory or manifest
    method: manifest
    # If method is "directory", path of the directory whose contents will be read as {dataset}/{sample}.bw
    directory: covg_bigwig
    # If method is "manifest", path to a tab-delimited manifest file with three columns:
    # dataset, sample, path to bigWig file.
    manifest: coverage_manifest.tsv
  # Optional: File containing paths to phenotype tables to regress out
  # pheno_paths: null

# Binning parameters
binning:
  # Method to use for binning: adaptive1, adaptive2, adaptive3, bin-width, or n-bins 
  # Whether to determine bins adaptively from coverage data, split all coding/noncoding regions into fixed-width bins, or split each region into a fixed number of bins.
  # TODO describe each method in more detail
  method: n-bins
  # Number of genes (at most) per batch
  batch_size: 20
  # Parameters for adaptive binning
  adaptive:
    # Maximum number of coverage samples to use for binning. Samples from all datasets are used, and a random subset is selected if there are more than this number.
    max_samples: 64
    # For method "adaptive2" or "adaptive3", approximate number of bins to create per gene on average.  
    bins_per_gene: 256
    # For method "adaptive1", minimum allowed mean total coverage per sample for a bin.
    min_mean_total_covg: 128
    # For method "adaptive1", maximum allowed correlation between normalized coverage of adjacent bins.
    max_corr: 0.8
  # Parameters for fixed-width binning  
  fixed_width:
    # Width of bins for coding (exonic) regions of the genes.
    coding: 16
    # Width of bins for noncoding (non-exonic) regions of the genes.
    noncoding: 128
  # Number of bins per exonic/intronic region for n-bins method
  n_bins: 24
  # Maximum width of any bin

# Model parameters
model:
  # Maximum variance explained by PCs to keep. Pass 0 or 1 for no variance explained cutoff.

  # Whether to use functional PCA
  use_fpca: false
